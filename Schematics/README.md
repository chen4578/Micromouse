# Power Delivery Schematic

The main component for the power delivery system will be the voltage regulator. The one we will be using is the AZ1117IH-3.3TRG1 Voltage Regulator. The following is the circuit diagram for the voltage regulator.

As seen in the circuit, we also need a 10 and 22 uF capacitor. Specifically, we decided to use a MLCC (multilayer ceramic capacitor) with a package/case of 0603 for compactness and to simplify soldering for both capacitors.

In order to connectthe batteries to the PCB and the breakout board, we need two JST connectors. We use B2B-PH-K-S JST connectors because they connect well to the batteries.

Below is the completed schematic:
